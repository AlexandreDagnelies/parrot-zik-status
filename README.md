Welcome to Parrot Status!
===================

This all started out when my iPhone got broken and I had a flight to catch. I found myself unable to modify my headphone and scoured the web looking for a desktop app for my Mac. Fortunately I did find one created by [vincent-le-normand](https://github.com/vincent-le-normand/Parrot-Status) and decided to expand on it. My motivating factor was to learn **Swift/Xcode**


> **Note:**
> This is still a very early Alpha stage. But I feel comfortable sharing it with everyone to get more people working on it and also use this as a learning process.
