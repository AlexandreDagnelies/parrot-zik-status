I found myself unable to modify my headphone and scoured the web looking for a desktop app for my Mac. Fortunately I did find one created by [vincent-le-normand](https://github.com/vincent-le-normand/Parrot-Status) and decided to expand on it. My motivating factor was to learn **Swift/Xcode**\r\n\r\n\r\n> **Note:**\r\n> This is still a very early Alpha stage. But I feel comfortable sharing it with everyone to get more people working on it and also use this as a learning process.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis software is distributed under **MIT** Licence.\r\n\r\n**Parrot and Parrot Zik are registered trademarks.**\r\n\r\nWe are not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Parrot S.A, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates.
